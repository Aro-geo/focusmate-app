# FocusMate Database Connection Test

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Environment Variables
- ✅ Added missing `JWT_SECRET` to `.env`
- ✅ Fixed Supabase URL consistency between frontend and backend

### 2. Database Schema
- ✅ Updated database schema to include all required tables:
  - `users` table with proper authentication fields
  - `todos` table with `title` column (not `task`)
  - `user_preferences`, `user_sessions`, `user_activity_logs` tables

### 3. API Endpoints
- ✅ Created `auth-signup.js` endpoint (redirects to `auth-register.js`)
- ✅ Fixed `toggle-task.js` to use POST method and handle `completed` field
- ✅ Verified `add-task.js` and `get-user-data.js` endpoints

### 4. Frontend Services
- ✅ Fixed token storage inconsistency (`authToken` vs `token`)
- ✅ Created `TaskApiService` to handle API calls properly
- ✅ Updated `useTodos` hook to use API service instead of direct Supabase

## Next Steps:

1. **Run Database Setup:**
   ```bash
   node scripts/db-setup-rls.js
   ```

2. **Test Database Connection:**
   ```bash
   node test-db-connection.js
   ```

3. **Start Development Server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   - Added `JWT_SECRET` to `.env`
   - Removed hardcoded Supabase credentials from frontend

2. **Database Schema:**
   - Added all required tables with proper relationships
   - Fixed column names to match frontend expectations

3. **API Consistency:**
   - All endpoints now use consistent authentication
   - Proper error handling and response formats

4. **Frontend Integration:**
   - Simplified task management through API service
   - Fixed token storage and retrieval
   - Proper error handling in React hooks

## Testing Checklist:

- [ ] Database connection successful
- [ ] User registration works
- [ ] User login works
- [ ] Task creation works
- [ ] Task toggling works
- [ ] Task fetching works

The main issue was that your frontend was trying to use Supabase directly while your backend was set up for API-based communication. Now everything goes through the proper API endpoints with authentication.
