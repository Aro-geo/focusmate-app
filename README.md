- **Smart Navigation**: Sidebar navigation with clean, modern design
- **Task Management**: Interactive task list with priority levels and completion tracking
- **AI Integration**: GPT-powered responses and productivity tips

### 🚀 Database Setup Steps
1. **Environment Setup**: Copy `.env.example` to `.env` with the provided credentials
2. **Run Migrations**: Set up the database schema
```bash
npm run migrate
```
3. **Seed Data** (Optional): Add sample data for testing
```bash
npm run db:seed
```

### 🌩️ Neon Serverless Database Integration

#### Server-side Access
We use optimized connection pooling for server-side database access with improved connection handling for serverless functions:

```javascript
// Example connection from serverless function
const { getPool } = require('./db-utils');
const pool = await getPool();
const result = await pool.query('SELECT * FROM users');
```

#### Client-side Direct Database Access
For client components, we've implemented a secure direct database access pattern using Neon's serverless driver:

1. **Security Features**:
   - JWT authentication for database connections
   - Row Level Security (RLS) for data isolation
   - Host information provided via secure API endpoint

2. **Usage Example**:
```tsx
// Using the custom hook
const { todos, addTodo, toggleTodo, deleteTodo } = useTodos();
```

3. **Setup RLS Policies**:
```bash
node scripts/db-setup-rls.js
```
